# CSE-225-DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS
This course is about an introduction to the theory and practice of data structuring techniques. Topics include internal data representation, abstract data types (ADT), stacks, queues, list structures, recursive data structures, trees, regraphs and networks. Concept of object orientation as a data abstraction technique will be introduced.  Course Objectives: The objectives of this course are to  introduce the basic data structures for storage and retrieval of ordered or unordered data using arrays, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, graphs and hash tables. introduce the concept of problem domain analysis and exploit the domain features to improve data structures efficiency. develop the concept of asymptotic analysis using Big-O techniques to compare different algorithmic solutions.
